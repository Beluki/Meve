## About

dir is a small, elegant puzzle game written in Lua, using the excellent
[Love2D][] framework. I wrote it as a birthday gift for a friend.

It's also my attempt at designing a game that appeals to both casual and
hardcore audiences, without relying on quick reflexes or time limits.

Here are two screenshots:
